Psalm 1
¹ BLESSED is the man that
walketh not in the counsel of
the ungodly, nor standeth in
the way of sinners, nor sitteth
in the seat of the scornful.

² But his delight is in the law
of the LORD; and in his law doth
he meditate day and night.

³ And he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water,
that bringeth forth his fruit in
his season; his leaf also shall
not wither; and whatsoever he 
doeth shall prosper.
