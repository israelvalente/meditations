        <p>
            ¹ BLESSED is the man that<br>
            walketh not in the counsel of<br>
            the ungodly, nor standeth in<br>
            the way of sinners, nor sitteth<br>
            in the seat of the scornful.<br>

            ² But his delight is in the law<br>
            of the LORD; and in his law doth<br>
            he meditate day and night.<br>

            ³ And he shall be like a tree<br>
            planted by the rivers of water,<br>
            that bringeth forth his fruit in<br>
            his season; his leaf also shall<br>
            not wither; and whatsoever he<br>
            doeth shall prosper.
