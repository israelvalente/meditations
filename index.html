        <h3>Psalm 1</h3>
        <p>
            ¹ BLESSED is the man that
            walketh not in the counsel of
            the ungodly, nor standeth in
            the way of sinners, nor sitteth
            in the seat of the scornful.

            ² But his delight is in the law
            of the LORD; and in his law doth
            he meditate day and night.

            ³ And he shall be like a tree
            planted by the rivers of water,
            that bringeth forth his fruit in
            his season; his leaf also shall
            not wither; and whatsoever he
            doeth shall prosper.
